<!--Instructions

1. Structure your HTML file
Your Github repository contains an empty HTML file (index.html). Insert the HTML document structure you have learned so far in this course. The chatter app has two sections, the channel area and the chat area. In a later challenge we will align them side by side. For now, it’s easier to place the chat beneath the channels.
Add the title “chatter|app” to your document head.
2. Create channels in the channel area
Add the app’s name also as a heading to the very top of your app. You will change it into an app bar later on. 
Add five random thread topics (channels).
Add three buttons: new, trending and favorites. 
Tip: If you’re curious how to make your buttons look like those in the sample solution, either google ‘HTML buttons’ or visit one of our favorite websites W3Schools.
3. Create a chat history in the chat area
To keep the channels and the chat area apart, insert a horizontal rule (hr tag) or other content that separates them.
Pick one of the channels you came up with. The conversation in that channel is displayed in your chat area.
Place the channel name at the top of the chat area. There will be an app bar at a later point, too.
Tip: The app will have two app bars and both app bars are of equal importance. Thus, their html tag should be the same.
Add a random location (e.g., “by cheeses.yard.applies”) next to the channel name, inside the future app bar. This three-word location shows where the channel was created. You generate a three-word location of your choice by using what3words. Make the location smaller by using an appropriate tag.

Tip: Which HTML Tag would be appropriate? We haven’t covered it yet. Ask Google or w3schools.com for something like: “HTML tag smaller”.
Write a short, fictional chat. Include three random messages but not more than six.
The message’s headline is composed of its metadata (location, weekday, date, and time). Your chat messages should be posted from at least two different locations.
Add a time to live (ttl) to the heading. The time indicates when the message will be deleted. We consider this information as more important than location, date and time, so please emphasize it by using an appropriate tag.
Tip: Use a heading tag for the whole line and nest the ttl with the appropriate emphasize tag.
The actual message content should be displayed beneath the heading. Be creative and come up with your own content.
Finally, attach a +5 min button to each message in a new line. The button’s purpose will be to extend the message’s time to live by five minutes later in the course.
4. Check your code
Check your code before you move on to the next challenge, especially for nesting and syntax mistakes and secure an extra point.
Clean up your code and insert comments for clarity and comprehensibility.
5. Save your code
